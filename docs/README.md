# Documentation

This repository maintains documentation in two layers:

- **`docs/hytale/`** — Notes and operational guidance about the *Hytale dedicated server software* (derived from the official manual and related articles).
- **`docs/image/`** — Documentation for the Docker image `ghcr.io/hybrowse/hytale-server` (usage, configuration, operations).

## Scope & sources

We aim to keep these docs practical and operations-focused.
For authoritative information, always refer to the official Hytale documentation:
